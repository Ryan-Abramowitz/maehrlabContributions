# Contributions to Maehrlab

Welcome to my contributions page for projects at Maehrlab! Here, I showcase the work I've been involved in, focusing on groundbreaking research in the field of epigenomics, transcriptomics, and cellular biology. My role in these projects ranges from data analysis to developing code. Below are links to the publications and associated code repositories for these significant contributions.

## Featured Projects

### Generation and Molecular Characterization of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Pharyngeal Foregut Endoderm

This research represents a pivotal step towards understanding the developmental biology of human pluripotent stem cells and their potential in regenerative medicine. I contributed to the molecular characterization aspect, focusing on epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving cell differentiation.
